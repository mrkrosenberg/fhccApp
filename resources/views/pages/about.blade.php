        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            A local climbing organization based in Jefferson County, Colorado, along the beautiful front range and just 
            west of Denver. We are here to advocate for climbing, climbing areas and the people who use them.
            We serve as a mediator between land managers, local governments and the climbers.
